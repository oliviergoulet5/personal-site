        <p>
            I've always been passionate about becoming a software developer. 
            I decided to pursue web development because it is what I think to be the most fun. 
            When I am not sitting at a computer I enjoy watching sports and movies with family & friends.

        <p>
            In 2018, I moved to Toronto to study Computer Programming & Analysis at Seneca College.
            <br /><br />
            During my college years, I attended multiple hackathons and met plenty of interesting future software developers.
            These events inspired me to keep on learning beyond the standard curriculum and to pursue side-projects that I can be proud of.
